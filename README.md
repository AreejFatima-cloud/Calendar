# Calendar
I created an interactive calendar using the "dyCalendar JavaScript library", offering a sleek and customizable way to display dates on your website.

This project utilizes the dyCalendar JavaScript library to create a dynamic and customizable calendar for web applications. With dyCalendar, you can easily integrate a stylish date display into your website, complete with various customization options such as themes, date formats, and more. This implementation is lightweight, easy to use, and perfect for enhancing user interaction with date-related functionalities on your web pages.
